# AI-Agent-Orchestration

Welcome to **AI-Agent-Orchestration**! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores **AI Agents** using the **CrewAI framework**, demonstrating how multiple agents can collaborate on tasks efficiently.

## 📌 Overview

This notebook walks through the process of **building and orchestrating AI agents** with CrewAI. It covers:

- **Introduction to AI Agents** – Understanding how AI-driven agents operate.
- **Installing and Setting Up CrewAI** – A framework for multi-agent collaboration.
- **Using AI Agents with Serper Search Tool** – Enabling real-time web searches.
- **Creating AI Agents for Research & Writing** – Defining agent roles and delegation.
- **Task Assignment & Execution** – Assigning tasks and managing workflow execution.
- **Hands-On Implementation** – Running a full AI-agent workflow.

## ⚡ Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – AI agents interact to complete a task.
- **Real-World AI Applications** – Demonstrates how agents can research and generate content.
- **Agent-Orchestration with CrewAI** – Simplifies complex AI workflows.
- **Interactive Notebook** – Modify and extend the project to fit different use cases.
